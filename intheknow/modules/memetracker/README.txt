Memetracker
--------------------------
The memetracker module uses algorithms in the machinelearningapi to intelligently filter and group content from designated content sources both internal and external. The module's purpose is to find and display to a community in real time the most interesting conversations and memes within the community as they emerge.

Memetrackers seeks to emulate the functionality of successful commercial memetrackers such as Techmeme, Google News, Tailrank, and Megite. It will be an open-source implementation of memetracking technology that can be easily plugged into Drupal-based community sites.
